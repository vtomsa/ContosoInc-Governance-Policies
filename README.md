2# Microsoft Azure Enterprise Scaffold12
This repo is meant to provide sample templates, runbooks and scripts to jumpstart the implementation of the [Azure Enterprise Scaffold](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-subscription-governance/) governance approach. In real life, scaffolding is used to create the basis of the structure. The scaffold guides the general outline, and provides anchor points for more permanent systems to be mounted. An enterprise scaffold is the same: a set of flexible controls and Azure capabilities that provide structure to the environment, and anchors for services built on the public cloud. It provides the builders (IT and business groups) a foundation to create and attach new services. 

## Automating Azure Resource Manager Policy Management
The PowerShell scripts, automation runbooks and policy json files are focused on automating [Azure Resource Manager Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-policy). The repo folders contain the following:
### [/policydef](https://github.com/karlkuhnhausen/azure-scaffold/tree/master/policydef)
A set of sample json files that define sample policies. [Other examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-policy#policy-definition-examples) can be found on azure.microsoft.com. Some of which I have cribbed here.
### [/runbooks](https://github.com/karlkuhnhausen/azure-scaffold/tree/master/runbooks)
An example Azure Automation runbook to demonstrate the creation of Azure Resource Manager policies from policy json files in an Azure Storage Account using the Run-As Account (Service Principal). This demonstrates defining and applying policies across multiple subscriptions. It also outlines an approach to automate the build pipeline with Visual Studio Team Services to automate the process from editing a policy file to applying it to subscriptions.
### [/scripts](https://github.com/karlkuhnhausen/azure-scaffold/tree/master/scripts)
Sample PowerShell scripts meant to be run interactively that demonstrate the policy definition and policy assignment cmdlets.
